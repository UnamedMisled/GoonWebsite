    <p style="font-size: large;background-color: aliceblue;">Jaden(img#1) used to be a little pip squeak that looked like lord farquad. The guy was a goof. He was known for his humongus forehead and was such a silly man. I believe he failed every class in middle school. His friend group contained Samuel Lathem(img#2)</p>
